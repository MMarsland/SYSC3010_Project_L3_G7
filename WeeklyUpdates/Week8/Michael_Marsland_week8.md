### Group number: L3_G7
### Student name: Michael Marsland
### Week: Week 8 (March 7-13)  

1. ***How many hours did you spend on the project this week? (0-10)***
   - About 13 hours were spent on the project this week between writing the design document, preparing for the end to end demo, and continuing writing code for the WaterBuddy software
2. ***Give rough breakdown of hours spent on 1-3 of the following:***
(meetings, information gathering, design, research, brainstorming, evaluating options, prototyping options, writing/documenting, refactoring, testing, software implementation, hardware implementation)
   1. Report Writing (8)
   2. Software Implementation/Testing (2)
   3. Software Implementation (3)
1. ***What did you accomplish this week?***
   - Completed the Detailed Design Document (Prepared the draft, completed the final version)
   - Finalized the database schema and completed the programs ability to pass massages and data between the water buddy and the smartphone application
   - Refactored some of the end to end demo work to create a stronger data framework
   - Created the structure for the WaterBuddy main loop that will control the device
   - Created threading in the senseHatDispaly class that allows messages to be shown while the main loop continues
   - Researched Pythonic interfaces for relating the hardware and hardware simulators: (Decided to just use "Duck" typing, (no set interface))
     -  Python Interfaces: https://realpython.com/python-interface/#using-abstract-method-declaration
2. ***How do you feel about your progress?***
   - Fantastic progress this week! Glad to have gotten a lot of work done before the end to end demo and the codebase is really coming together.
   - Writing the design document was a great way to force clarity on my intended implementation now so it is easy to see how the rest of the code will come together.
   - I've got the framework for the mainloop and system data passing designed and even looked into the frameworks for writing a test stuite for the unit test demo
3. ***What are you planning to do next week***?
   - This week I will continue working on the main loop to finish implementing the framework I layed out
   - I will also be establishing a local SQL database for the water buddy's settings and water history
4. ***Is anything blocking you that you need from others?***
   - Nothing blocking, the team is working very well together!
