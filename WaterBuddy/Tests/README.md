# WATER BUDDY SYSTEM TEST FOLDER
This folder contains test files for both the Water Buddy system hardware and software.

The tests written here encompass the required functionality at the time of the unit test demo
and for the most part have not been updated or expanded for the final project.

## HARDWARE
The hardware test files can be found in the [hardwareTests folder](hardwareTests)

## SOFTWARE
The system software tests can be found in the [pyTests folder](pyTests)

The system software unit tests can be run with
    pytest -s
from the pyTests folder.
